# Swoy/Huber docs

[![N|Solid](https://cldup.com/dTxpPi9lDf.thumb.png)](https://blacknred.github.io/)

IM and voice cloud platform to communicate and work together.

Why?

- Twitter is a messy and only public.
- Slack is only corporate email with integrations aesthetically but the ability use one workspace as an app and do not be distracted by other notifications is a cool.
- Discord is very good but we need more timeline feeds since the multiple space switching between is tiresome, despites Discord dont use feeds and feed algos ideologically. Also we need more lightweight ui & ux i think.
- Youtube text content/discussions is not represented as well as video

- channel based twitter with private subscriptions
  - good for influencers, not so good for streamers
  - same algo feed based schema for insta, tiktok
- media chat with spaces for friends and coworkers
  - influencers are only channels & communities, good for streamers
  - for example, discord is a chat, not a feed, it’s also free of the algorithms that creators so often bemoan. If influencers want to announce that they have a new video out, or promote a merch sale, they can post a message to everyone in the #announcements channel of their Discord server instead of posting about it on Instagram and hoping the post gets served to a wide enough portion of their audience.

Feeds are async while chats are instant.

- user-world relation, not like group-groups in discord or user-group in slack
- user can in one click(messender ui/ux)
  - participate in discussions and read news in text channels
  - watch streamed audio/video content(podcasts, lives, misic, studying/lections, movies) from user or sourced outside in stream channels
  - get instant notifications
- public/private channels
- creators need to create a channel to broadcast
- there are lists(channel folders, family etc) and public/private spaces(communities of channels with own integrations & rules)
- teams/organizations need to create a private space/office, community - a public one
- dms/calls the same level threads, lists, spaces
- webhooks(channel relation, space relation)

## Application

### User

#### Authentication

For every client app and every time you sign in you need to enter auth source(?email/phone) and use a short digit confirmation code from it. After local confirmation the APP creates an access token(x-token) and a refresh token(x-refresh-token) that client app will store both locally.\
Requests with access token will use quick auth by memory cache session.\
Despite APP not use passwords at all, there is kinda a 2FA(two-factor authentication) is used since access token includes some info about initial client device as well that server will check by comparing with request metadata from actual device. This way stolen access token will be useless on another device.

#### Restore access

In case you lost access to auth source(?email/phone) you can restore access with one of two ways:

- if you are member of any Space you can ask advanced user of that Space get you special access link
- after first login you can generate a disposable restoration token from profile settings page, save it and use in such a cases. The next time you will need preliminarily generate a new one.

Set the new auth source right after restoration.

#### Data

User data represented by username, fullname, description, contacts, avatar, email, phone and timezone.
Timezone is used for for summary and notification emails, reminders and times in activity feeds.\
Within the space user also has role and optional ones: description, inactivity status and inactivity schedule.\
Common profile data and some Space related data can be changed in profile settings.

### Space

Space is an entity to host your community or organization.\
Space has own name, description and avatar. Space can be private which will be your option for organization or team.\
The main entities of Space are participants and threads.

#### Participants

Every user can create a new Space, join existed one and switch between available ones.
Joining public Space is free but for private one there are three ways:

- advanced Space user can directly add an existing APP user
- new APP user will automatically be joined the Space after registration by approved corporate domain email
- advanced Space user can create a short-lived invitation link that can be publicly shared anywhere or privately sent to certain email.

User can be joined with auto deactivation after time. This could be useful case for Space guests.\
Every user except owner can leave Space and delete data at will.

`Invitations`

Private personal invitation will become invalid after the first successful registration from the email. This way it cant be reused. Public invitations can be used multiple times. Advanced Space users can observe all created invitations with the participants that have been joined through them and manage these invitations as well: extend life time or delete.

`Roles`

Within the Space a user has a one of composite role:

- Guests: clients, freelancers, interns. They can post and make calls only in channels they have been invited.
- Members: common users. Can post and make calls in all joined threads and also create and manage own threads.
- Admins: super members. Members that have access to Space administration.
- Owner: creator or delegated user. A person with extra Space administration including Space deletion.

The admins and owner are advanced Space users.\
Admins can ban the members and owner can ban the admins.\

`Groups`

Group is a collection of users within a Space for easy notification and invitation. Groups, like users, can be mentioned anyplace in APP like @relatives @designers etc.

#### Threads

The thread can be a channel or DM.\
Important threads can be starred for later quick access.\
Thread can be created with auto deletion with the all content after specific period.

`Channel`

Channel is a topic-centered thread with optional description and avatar.\
Channels can be public which you can join just by click or private in which case you need an invitation to join. Public channels can be converted to private but not vice versa due the privacy reasons. You can also restrict channel access to readonly for certain or most users for cases like announcement, broadcast or stream channels.\
There are text and audio channels in terms of content. Text channels allow to post messages and files, like any general message discussion, while audio ones are for meetings and streams. You can use camera and screen sharing for audio channels as well.\
Due the unlimited count of participants the text channels use focused and organized side conversations for message replies. Messages with more than 3 replies will display them as a separate thread.\

There are additional channel options:

- Default - default public channels will automatically join all existed and new users. Cannot be leaved.
- Sharing - channel can be shared between Spaces. After the initiator selects Spaces to be connected and get confirmation from them the sharing will coming. Connected Spaces or initiator can break a channel sharing anytime.

The unwanted channels except default can be archived or completely deleted. Archived channels can be unarchived by creator.

`DM`

DM is a direct conversation that limited up to 8 members. With an increase in the number of participants it have to be converted to a private channel.\
In DM you can post messages, files and make calls with camera and screen sharing as well. Message replies in DM are not threaded.\
Personal DM can be used as a notepad and file saver.

`Default thread categories`

In common all available threads are organised in default categories:

- Starred - all user starred threads appear in pinned folder for quick access.
- Channels - all user available channels, sorted by most frequently usage or recent activity.
- Direct - DMs user use most frequently.

All items in default folders support notification counting. Threads with unread messages will have bold font name and the counter badge will be incremented with all new messages or only by DM, mentions, reactions and keywords.

`Custom thread categories`

User can create and manage custom categories for available thread organization within the Space. Category includes name and optional icon.\
The thread included in custom category will not be listed in default ones.

`Feeds`

There are some feeds(virtual threads) available to user in Space:

- Drafts - unsent messages from all threads are listed here. Hidden if there are no any of them.
- Pulse - mentions, reactions and keywords user has from all threads including not joined ones. Supports notification counting.
- Trending - channels that algorithmically rated as hot by criterias like new, not default, most viewed and active etc. Notification channel suggestions from time to time based on user activity.
- Saved items - all user bookmarked messages and files.

`Updates`

- Within the session user may has some pubsub clients(web, desktop, mobile), __timezone__ and last activity time(__lat__).
- The __client activity__ is based on detecting cursor and keyboard activity.
- User can change __thread notification politic__ - to notify about:
  - all updates
  - only main updates: DM, reactions, mentions and keywords
  - no updates: muting channels and direct messages you only need to check occasionally.
- Inactivity status & schedule
  Within Space an user can set up optional inactivity status: dnd, away, on call and active. 
  
  The last one (to receive notifications during your working hours, also based on user timezone).\
 and .\
  
  inactivity schedule: work and rest hours for a week. In inactivity times updates will going on but notifications will be not shown/alert.\
  In case status was not setted up it will be represented as user LAT translations:
  - up to 10sec: 'active'
  - up to 5min: 'was recently'
  - over 5 min: 'was active n time ago'
  - over 30 min: 'away'
  User can set up dnd status for a specific amount of time:
  /dnd 15 mins
  /dnd until 5pm
  /dnd off

With initial Space loading the thread unread activity are counted based on __lat__.
Realtime thread unread activity are processed by next steps:

- backend
  - create/update/delete message in thread
    - if pubsub client subscribed on thread broadcast message to it
    - if pubsub client not subscribed on thread
      - fetch all thread users with allowed __thread notification politic__(?cached)
      - if such users includes pubsub client and if update is required broadcast update flag to it
  - get thread read signal from client
    - find all user pubsub clients and send them __thread read signal__
  - feeds
    - pulse
    - trending
- frontend
  - thread updating on client
    - active thread
      - concat all new messages. Use sound notifications based on __thread notification politic__
      - if __client active__ and __last message in viewport__ then auto scroll unread messages
      - if __client not active__ or __last message not in viewport__ then disable autoscroll and update __counter badge__  based on __thread notification politic__. __counter badge__  will be throwed off by scrolling.
      - if __client not active__ show push notifications with update preview based on __thread notification politic__
    - not active threads
      - update __counter badge__ or __live status__ with sound notifications.
    - __counter badge__  will be throwed when thread stands active.
    - when all updates are read client notifies other user clients about it through the service
  - get thread read signal
    - clear __counter badge__ updates

?To prevent notifications on all user clients at time in case of there are a few user pubsub clients, try send updates to minimal __lat__ client at first. After timeout other pubsub clients will be updated also with notifications(by flag) or without if the first client returned __thread read signal__ before timeout.

`Moderation`

Owner can archive public channel with unwanted content and remove it completly after 6 monthes of inactivity. If such a thread will be unarchived by creator the owner or admin can ban member temporary or remove him from Space completely.

#### Messaging

User can send message and edit or delete own messages within the text threads and DMs.
There are extra operations with message:

- Mark unread
- Save - message can be bookmarked for yourself within the Space.
- Share - message can be forwarded to other threads.
- Pin - message can be pinned to thread for every thread member.
- Reply - message can be replied by another one. Text channels include the reply messages in separate threads.
- Add a reaction - user can react to message with one-click emoji reactions or any suitable ones.

Conversations are marked as read on thread opening, starting where you left off by default. It can be changed to auto scrolling to the bottom.\
All unsent messages are automatically saving as a drafts.\
The current message typing information is also shown.\
Message can be deleted after specified time. Related files will be deleted also.\
Space is limited by most recent 10,000 messages and 10 gb space for files. When the limit is reached, old messages and files will begin to be deleted to free up space for new ones.

## Integrations



New functionality can be integrated with external services. Service is something that computes and return/send data by request or schedule. External service can offer own functionality or connect existed services.\
To accept data from external service App needs to register it as webhook - a "reverse API" approach that brings client the new data without polling it.\
There are system and custom webhooks in the App. The system webhooks are public to all Spaces. The custom ones can be public or private - restricted to the . Advanced users of the Space can add or remove Space available webhooks.\

Webhook functionality can be available via shortcuts menu and slash commands.
Bot will hook mentions from any channel or bot DM.
Currently the only available event is message push and payload content-type is json

### System webhooks

#### Assistant bot

- Description: multitasking assistant bot
- Permissions: message posting
- Implementation: Service stores and process context data and reminders for tasks and events
- Usage:

1. Human like dialogs by processing message keywords/context: 'What events are coming up this week?', 'when are holidays' etc. Advanced users of Space can provide Space related knowledge base to cover topics and issues for rest members: 'who is in the office today?', 'what is the password for the office Wi-Fi?' etc.
2. User can set a reminder within the Space for himself, a co-member or channel about any event or task with text topic and optionally releted message or thread. The reminder time can be setted up to minutes as timeout or interval. Assistant bot will send a DM with the reminder description at the preferred time.
Reminder can be also setted by slash commands:

/remind me|@arcadio|@frontend|#sells Submit report May 30
/remind list(reminder can be deleted from here)

#### Moderator bot

There are user rating and stopwords list options that can be enabled in Space. User rating is based on count of positive reaction he had in all public channels.\
Stopwords are used to filter unwanted content within the Space. To set a keyword list you have to have advanced role

18+

violence
flood

#### Stats bot?

#### Tasks bot
status + priority

Hubs

#### Email Service

- Description: email forwarding to any channel or DM
- Permissions: message posting
- Implementation: Service handles emails, formats and sends them as messages to the thread.
- Usage:

1. Request an email address for thread. Use the address directly or set up automatic forwarding from email provider(gmail, ms outlook): <https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10957?hl=en>, <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/turn-on-automatic-forwarding-in-outlook-on-the-web-7f2670a1-7fff-4475-8a3c-5822d63b0c8e?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us%20*/>
2. All emails sent to this address will be forwarded to the thread

the webhook which handles and stores emails and sends them as messages to thread.

#### RSS feed service

- Description: RSS and Atom feed forwarding to any channel or DM
- Permissions: message posting
- Implementation: Service periodically fetches updates from rss feeds, filters by keywords, formats and sends them as messages to the thread.
- Usage:

1. Add a feed/feeds to thread and set optionally an update period and keywords(to get only related content). If you get an error with feed adding, try validating the feed at <http://validator.w3.org/feed/>
2. Channel will be periodically updated with rss feeds messages

### Custom webhooks

Any user can add new webhook. User can delegate webhook ownership to another user.
The common use cases for new webhooks are services that:

- route notifications from other services
- show data by request: sales statistics, reports, leads, calls, etc
- implements lexical analysis for study app or something
- do experimental stuff like a bot that can open or close doors, or turn on a coffee machine via a slash command

`Create webhook`

1. provide a name and description and avatar by optional
2. provide service url(http://4ds23d1.ngrok.io/hook) and secret to authenticate request to your service
3. provide event to trigger the hook and permissions. Currently the only available event is message push and payload content-type is json. Available permissions are message posting and file saving.
4. Provide aprivateness
5. test webhook with a ping button to complete creation
6. save the access token and use it for authenticate webhook service requests. Access tokens are used for authenticate to the Swoy API over basic authentication.

`The external service requirements`

Trigger and send event payload to service
The external service you choose to create and configure your webhook needs to provide you with the ability to make an HTTP request to back to Swoy.
Before payload processing it is important to respond quickly with a HTTP HEAD 2xx (200, 201, 202, etc.) status code.
After processing you have options:

- webhook request can have fallback and callback to back the result of processing
- app will generate a unique request URL your service can back the result of processing by POST/use an access token

Example message event handling workflow:

- add webhook to app
- add webhook to Space
- 

- outcoming api request(+secret)

- incoming webhook request(+token)


- message-service: received a message obj evnt via ws
- message-service: if isBot get related webhook endpoint from db else put message in db
- message-service: send to webhook headers[] body{} { payload with request signature(token + timestamp)}
- bot: send back 200ok status
- message-service: if no 200 status during 5sec send error else put message in db
- bot: parse command with NLP and process request(use keywords as event names)
- bot: send body message to message-server
